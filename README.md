# polar-oxides
A small experimentation with primes and polar coordinates

This is my [30 day project](https://dk30.day9.tv/projects/108445523291193344-1567550541907?t=1570981119338) for Day[9].
My goal was to get a little bit familiarized with Rust and practice what I learned after reading the Rust Book and watching
some online classes.

The inspiration for the idea behind this small project was [this video from 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ).

It uses the [Coffee Engine](https://github.com/hecrj/coffee) to get some sort of performance out of trying to draw millions of
points and with some very na√Øve culling it actually manages to work with one hundred million points on my PC (i7 7700k @ 5Ghz
and RTX 2080).

## Usage

By default, it will draw 50k points, but you can change it by passing it a command-line argument:

```
$ ./polar-oxides 10000000 # will generate 10 million points
```

## Commands

* **W**: Zoom In
* **S**: Zoom Out
* **F**: Toggle Fullscreen
* **D**: Toggle drawing of non-primes
